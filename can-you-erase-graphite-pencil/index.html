<p>Drawing pencils that have a B after them such as 2B 3B 4B contain soft graphite. Once the pencil is trapped under a layer of dry watercolour paint it is effectively sealed in and you will not be able to erase it. Vinyl erasers dont work unless you slide them over the mark. Gently pat dry with another soft cloth. You cannot blot a mark with a vinyl eraser. Can you erase graphite under watercolor.

<p>The first step in removing graphite and pencil lead stains is to identify the stained material. If you try to erase a heavy layer of graphite with any other type of eraser without first removing some of it with a kneaded eraser it might smear and you may even drive the graphite farther into the paper. It consists of fine particles of pumice stone that will allow to damage the paper a little more during the rubbing and to remove the part of the paper which has been tinted. To erase it use the blue end of the eraser. In my case thats 2B because I find anything softer to be too grainy in appearance. This is easy to do and quite fun with a kneaded eraser.

<p>Gently pat dry with another soft cloth. Gently rub the eraser on the stained material making sure not to distort the surface with too much pressure and wipe away any eraser dust that may have been left behind. Graphite pencils are much easier to erase in general meaning that any mistakes can be easily recovered without risking damaging the page. Unsurprisingly one of the best ways to get graphite off of any surface is with a soft eraser. By hard graphite pencil I am referring to any pencil that is labeled between 9H and 2H. A vinyl eraser removes soft graphite marks and significantly reduces the appearance of hard graphite pencil marks.
