<p><strong>9h Pencil Hardness</strong>, The Pencil Hardness test is used to determine the scratch resistance of a coating surface by using pencils to scratch the surface and rate the scratch resistance in relation to that pencils hardness and other materials of similar hardness. As the pencil core becomes softer through the use of lower. These pencils are soft.</p>

<p>Using this scale the hardness of the core is often marked on the pencil look for a number such as 2 2-12 or 3. Typical glass hardness being at about a five with diamonds being a ten. In fact the word H in 9H refers to the hardness of the graphite pencil H means hardness Bblack blackness the higher value the B the darker color and softer the pencil is the higher the value H the harder a pencil is the lighter the color.</p>

Thats why a Ceramic Coating Said that the ceramic coating hardness is 9H is not one level below diamond and is not scratch resistant it is but for 9H by pencil hardness scratches and not what we expect it to be. The set of Elcometer 3080 Hardness Testing Pencils is a simple but effective technique to evaluate the hardness of many coatings. The first graphite grading scale is a numeric scale. If 9H pencil gives a scratch but 8H does not the coating hardness is 8H.</p>

<p>HB stands for hard black which means medium hard. The problem with the pencil scale is that it doesnt go higher then 9H so a coating with a hardness of 7 Mohs would still score as 9H in the pencil scale.

<p>The H suffix in the 9H refers to the hardness of a pencil with a lead hardness. During testing the manufacturers scratch the surface of the screen protector starting with the 6B pencil with the softest lead hardness to the 9H pencil with the toughest lead hardness. Despite an impressive pencil hardness of 9H for the current CEOSPEMA-g-PDMS coating its Martens hardness value of 052 002 GPa is lower than 070 001 GPa reported for the GPOSS NP-GLIDE coating. 9H-9B with the H end of the spectrum being the harder and the B obviously the softer. Thats why a Ceramic Coating Said that the ceramic coating hardness is 9H is not one level below diamond and is not scratch resistant it is but for 9H by pencil hardness scratches and not what we expect it to be.

Then hardness continues as the pencils go from HB to F to H to 2H to 3H and all the way up to 9H. The higher the number the harder the writing core and the lighter the mark left on the paper. The Pencil Hardness test is used to determine the scratch resistance of a coating surface by using pencils to scratch the surface and rate the scratch resistance in relation to that pencils hardness and other materials of similar hardness. HB stands for hard black which means medium hard. 10B 9B 8B 7B 6B 5B 4B 3B 2B B HB F H 2H 3H 4H 5H 6H 7H 8H 9H 10H. Pin On 9h Hardness And High Gloss Crystal Coating For Cars.</p>
