<p>While pen offers readable legible permanent results pencil gives you the flexibility of fixing the mistakes you might make and doesnt bleed through paper. I just started using a moleskin journal and I wanted to know for archival purposes if I should use pen or pencil. The direction is to use black or blue pen therefore using pencil would be contravening the instructions. However in my lab master thesis journals were written in pencil as the information is not lost in case of spilling. Experiment and find whats right for you. The ideas flow quickly because with a pen and paper I can draw sketches and use any alphabetical symbol to record ideas.

<p>If you feel strongly one way or the othergo for it. It runs out of ink fast but its worth it. Pens and pencils are equally sufficient for the purposes of journal writing. However pens typically offer a smoother feel while writing depending on the pen type and are more likely to stand the test of time. I dont expect it to be rubbed except when I rub it out so rubbing isnt a problem. Write your answers in blue or black pen.

<p>These pens came in disposable packaging but sets are now available in hard storagedisplay cases. Im going to assume you meant for some type of long-form writing. The ideas flow quickly because with a pen and paper I can draw sketches and use any alphabetical symbol to record ideas. The Sharpie Pen set that I have has 12 pens and 10 colors but Sharpie Art pens are also available in packs with 8 16 or 24 colors. Oh wait thats not what you meant. Sometimes I use an ink pen but its very fluid and it flows very well. 3pcs Two Finger Grip Silicone Children Learning Writing Pen Tool Gifts New In 2021 Pencil Grip Writing Pens Cool Writing.</p>
