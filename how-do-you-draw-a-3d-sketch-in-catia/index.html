<p>Get benefits of the 3DEXPERIENCE platform using CATIA V6. Hello Is there anyway to show a sketch from the part file in the drawing. These include trimming the sketches using the quick trim breaking a sketched element filleting the sketches adding chamfer to the sketches. Use the Sketch Analysis tool to check if the profiles is closed and if there are any extra geometry like points that are not in construction Also use colors to check if the sketch. We then use a Sweep feature to create cores through a casting. Why do you work in a sketch and not in 3D on support. Pin On 3d Cad Exercises.</p>
