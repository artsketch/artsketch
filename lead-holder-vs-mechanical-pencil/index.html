<p>Pilot S20 - 05mm mech pencil. I find that as with pens no single pencil suits all work. The reason I ask is that I found in my fathers effects a tube containing 100 15mm pencil leads. Wooden pencil lead wont break easily as the mechanical one. Does anybody know of such a thing as a 15mm lead holder or mechanical pencil.

<p>Pilot S20 - 05mm mech pencil. Does anybody know of such a thing as a 15mm lead holder or mechanical pencil. A key difference between a lead holder pencil and a standard mechanical pencil is the diameter of the graphite. But yeah we both draw the line at lead holders use lead sizes 20mm I suspect the distinction for me comes from that the leads themselves are in longer lengths and larger containers. Another key difference between lead holders and typical mechanical pencils is their lead advancement system. Many lead holders use a drop clutch lead advancement mechanism rather than the incremental advancement mechanism most mechanical pencils use.

<p>The barrel diameter of lead holders is often larger than regular wooden and mechanical pencils because they are made to accommodate tip sizes from 2 mm to 56 mm. Level 1 4y. Answer 1 of 5.
