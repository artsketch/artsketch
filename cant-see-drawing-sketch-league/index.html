<h3 id="also-happens-when-i-open-one-of-the-sketches">Also happens when I open one of the sketches.</h3><p>I need a help with a simple problem as far as i think. I had created a few very basic sketches without a problem but now when I go in to create a new sketch I cannot see anything I draw. My model has a number of out of plane 2D sketches that are not visible in my drawing. Because every time I try to draw something I am able to undo whatever I just drew. But the problem is I cant see what Im drawing.</p>
