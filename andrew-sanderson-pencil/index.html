<p>It bothered him that the tools to his trade were of such obviously poor quality. 138174 USD by 1616 backers on Jan 30 2015 with another platform. I hope you enjoy the design as much as I enjoyed making it. He subsequently switched to product design with the goal of creating a mechanical pencil that you could keep and use forever. As an Aerospace Engineer Andrew used a mechanical pencil every day. The better the texture the more the pencil has to abrade against.

<p>Tweet Share Email The First Bolt Action Mechanical Pencil. 138174 USD by 1616 backers on Jan 30 2015 with another platform. Andrew Sanderson enjoyed a successful career as an aviation engineer before deciding to devote himself full-time to inventing. After some research he found that even expensive pencils were cheaply made and relied on stock plastic parts. Now after a successful Kickstarter campaign I am working on producing and delivering over 2200 pencils to all corners of the world. - by Andrew Sanderson.
