<p>If your pencil doesnt include a cleaning rod you can try to find a thin piece of metal wire or safety pin but this can be very tough to do especially for 02 mm and 03 mm pencilsYou can get creative with this and try something like a very skinny pipe cleaner but just make sure that whatever you use for the job isnt going to make things worse or leave any fragments inside your pencil. To refill a Papermate mechanical pencil first you have to take off the whole backside including the rubber. Empty out the broken piece and load normally. Give it a shake and make sure you can see through the hole the lead goes through. To check if the mechanism is obstructed press but do not release the feed mechanism button and insert a lead through the point.

<p>So sometime during the 2nd grade I got my hands on my first Pentel Sharplet-2 This is truly where my mechanical pencil fetish began. When a woodcased pencil is freshly sharpened it writes a very thin line. The thickness or diameter of the nib of a mechanical pencil always remains the same. It has a 07 mm HB lead which is perfect for both writing and drawing and can be refilled. Remove the tip from the pencil and work the drill in gently from the tip end just a little bit there is probably a rubber ring back inside you dont want to damage. The thinnest graphite you will find in a mechanical pencil is about up to 02mm and the thickest one comes with a diameter of 09mm. Paper Mate Clearpoint 0 7 Mm Mechanical Pencil Review Youtube.</p>
